<h2 id="moving-into-product-design">Moving into product design</h2>

<p>This was the place where I truly started my design career. Geekie is an ed-tech based in São Paulo which focuses on developing adaptive learning products for schools and students. I joined as a communication analyst, helping grow Geekie’s reach across the country. However, being part of a cross-disciplinary product team made me realize how I could unite my passion for technology with design into something that can have meaningul impact.</p>

<h2 id="geekie-games">Geekie Games</h2>

<p>A year after I assumed the position of product designer within Geekie Games. The product is a test-prep web and android platform that leverages machine learning to best support each student’s learning curve when preparing for the national university admission exam in Brazil.</p>

<p>Geekie Games has a freemium model consisting of free exams and classes paired with a paid subscription that provides a gamified personalized study plan. It tackled a problem for a large part of students who where studying by themselves in the web but struggled to now what they should prioritize and how to evaluate their progress. The technology behind it showed a significant impact on increasing student’s grades and was featured globally, such as in this article in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/10/geekie-educational-software-brazil-machine-learning">The Guardian</a>.</p>
